EmpathAI: Emotion-Driven Chatbot with Context-Aware Intelligence EmpathAI is a cutting-edge chatbot system designed to provide empathetic and personalized interactions. By integrating advanced technologies for emotion detection, object recognition, and natural language processing, this project demonstrates the potential of human-centered AI.

Features
Emotion Detection: Uses real-time emotion recognition via DeepFace to analyze user emotions and respond empathetically. Contextual Responses: Adapts replies based on the userâ€™s emotional state and physical surroundings. Object Recognition: Utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time detection of objects visible through the webcam. Voice Input: Supports natural communication through speech for enhanced usability. Interaction with Multiple Users: Recognizes when new individuals enter the frame and engages in meaningful interactions. Mentor-Like Support: Provides emotional assistance during moments of sadness by encouraging users to share their problems. Multi-Modal Analysis: Combines webcam-based visual cues, voice input, and emotion-aware responses for a holistic interaction experience.

Technologies Used
DeepFace: Real-time emotion recognition. YOLOv8: Robust object detection. Llama 2 NeMetron.mini: Advanced natural language processing. Python: Core programming language for development. OpenCV: Image processing and webcam integration. Flask: Framework for building the application interface.

How It Works
Initial Setup:

The chatbot starts with a greeting and ensures webcam clarity. If the camera is obstructed, it prompts the user to adjust the view. Emotion and Context Detection:

Real-time emotion analysis adjusts responses to match the userâ€™s mood. Object detection enables contextual conversations about the userâ€™s surroundings. Dynamic User Interaction:

Recognizes when new individuals enter the frame and engages users with questions. Tracks user mood and responds with empathy or encouragement to share concerns.

Applications
Mental Health: Acts as a companion to support users during stressful or sad moments. Education: Creates engaging interactions for personalized learning experiences. Customer Engagement: Provides tailored responses for improved user satisfaction.

Future Enhancements
Integration of sentiment analysis for text-based conversations. Expansion to support additional languages for global usability. Improved facial recognition for multi-user tracking.
